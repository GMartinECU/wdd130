        <p>Farms are an incredibly useful and fun part of Minecraft. Mostly farms are used to get materials to build, or perhaps to mess with your friends online. What you do with the materials is up to you, but I take great pleasure in creating ways to most effectively get as much of something as I want. Making farms is not an easy process, but once they’re constructed, they can make your life much much easier. Perhaps the easiest farm to make is the most basic and literal food farm. Simply planting seeds in tilled dirt near water is a great way to get wheat in early-game. Wheat can be used to tame cows and can also be turned into bread for consumption. Food is always important; you’re never not going to need food. This basic farm is compact, easy, and timeless. A more complicated farm could be a creeper farm. By creating dark platforms covered in trapdoors, only creepers will be able to spawn there. By finding a way to kill them on a hopper on a chest, this can be a very effective way to farm gunpowder. Gunpowder is needed to craft fireworks, which allow you to fly more efficiently when paired with elytra, and also used to craft TNT, which is just a nice thing to have.
