      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>You or your kids ever play Minecraft? I’ve got an idea for a website that is a handy-dandy catalogue for all your Minecraft ins and outs. Minecraft is only getting bigger and bigger, and it’s getting tougher and tougher keeping track of what all the new mobs, blocks, and mechanics are. This website I want to make will make it easy to figure out what all the newest patches include, and how to best farm desirable blocks and items.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Those who play minecraft or know someone that does.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <p>
        Minecraft blocks and items catalogue
        Here you will find information about the most desirable items, blocks, and mobs in the most recent version of Java Minecraft. Along with information of the items, blocks, and mobs themselves, we also provide a tutorial on how to farm the desired item, block, or mob.
        With the newest update: Caves and Cliffs, the best way to obtain diamonds is to find a nice big cave and search around the appropriate y-level
        Desirable items in Minecraft include diamonds, emeralds, netherite, gold, experience points, gunpowder, paper, iron, and much much more. If there’s something you want to get in Minecraft, there’s probably a way to farm it.
        With all of the updates coming out, it can be pretty hard to keep up with all of the new items, blocks, and mobs coming out. Here we will talk about what’s new, what’s good about it, what’s bad about it, and just what it is in general. We plan to keep this updated from update to update and would like to have a history of the past updates to keep track of when certain things were released or when certain farms became obsolete or stopped working. New farms will be posted along with the updates.

      </ul>
      <h3>Blocks and Items</h3>
      <p>
        Here you will find information on all of the useful blocks and mobs in Minecraft Java edition (and there’s a lot!)
        At first we will only have the most useful and desirable mobs and blocks and their information, and on another page we have the information on how to properly utilize these mobs and blocks and how to farm them for your benefit.
        One of the first mobs which comes to mind is the wither skeleton, a mob which has a chance to drop a wither skeleton skull, an item necessary to summon The Wither, which drops an item used to create a beacon. The wither skeleton lives in the nether, a dangerous and scary place. In addition to only spawning in the nether, they only spawn on nether fortresses in the nether, which can be a bit difficult or tricky to find.

        A more basic mob to farm would be the cow, a mob which can be found very easily near grass in the overworld. Cows drop leather and raw beef, both of which are useful, the former for enchanting or armor, and the latter for food. In order to get a max level enchanting table, you must craft bookshelves which require books, which require leather and paper. Paper can be a little easier to get as long as you start farming it earlier by planting sugarcane near water.

      <h3>Farms</h3>
      <p>
        Farms are an incredibly useful and fun part of Minecraft. Mostly farms are used to get materials to build, or perhaps to mess with your friends online. What you do with the materials is up to you, but I take great pleasure in creating ways to most effectively get as much of something as I want. Making farms is not an easy process, but once they’re constructed, they can make your life much much easier.
        Perhaps the easiest farm to make is the most basic and literal food farm. Simply planting seeds in tilled dirt near water is a great way to get wheat in early-game. Wheat can be used to tame cows and can also be turned into bread for consumption. Food is always important; you’re never not going to need food. This basic farm is compact, easy, and timeless.
        A more complicated farm could be a creeper farm. By creating dark platforms covered in trapdoors, only creepers will be able to spawn there. By finding a way to kill them on a hopper on a chest, this can be a very effective way to farm gunpowder. Gunpowder is needed to craft fireworks, which allow you to fly more efficiently when paired with elytra, and also used to craft TNT, which is just a nice thing to have.
