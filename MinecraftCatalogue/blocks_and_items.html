        <p>Here you will find information on all of the useful blocks and mobs in Minecraft Java edition (and thereâ€™s a lot!) At first we will only have the most useful and desirable mobs and blocks and their information, and on another page we have the information on how to properly utilize these mobs and blocks and how to farm them for your benefit. One of the first mobs which comes to mind is the wither skeleton, a mob which has a chance to drop a wither skeleton skull, an item necessary to summon The Wither, which drops an item used to create a beacon. The wither skeleton lives in the nether, a dangerous and scary place. In addition to only spawning in the nether, they only spawn on nether fortresses in the nether, which can be a bit difficult or tricky to find. A more basic mob to farm would be the cow, a mob which can be found very easily near grass in the overworld. Cows drop leather and raw beef, both of which are useful, the former for enchanting or armor, and the latter for food. In order to get a max level enchanting table, you must craft bookshelves which require books, which require leather and paper. Paper can be a little easier to get as long as you start farming it earlier by planting sugarcane near water.
